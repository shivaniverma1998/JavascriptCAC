BLOCKING CODE VS NON-BLOCKING CODE

BLOCKING CODE - IT IS THE way to block the flow of program and it is fully restricted 
(EXAMPLE - read file synchronously is a type of blockking codeit means program cant do anything untill file reads )

NON-BLOCKING CODE - does not block execution  
(example - read file asynchronously  it means the the program doing things without blocking time  and not wait for use cases)
