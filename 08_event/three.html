<!-- javascript is synchronous language that means  its code execute one ater other then other  like in sequence
javascript is  threaded language 

execution context - execute one line of code at a time 
 for example console.log()1 ---- : console.log()2 -----:
 each operation waits for the last one to complete before executing 

CALLSTACK & MEMORY HEAP

BLOCKING CODE VS NON-BLOCKING CODE

BLOCKING CODE - IT IS THE way to block the flow of program and it is fully restricted 
(EXAMPLE - read file synchronously is a type of blockking codeit means program cant do anything untill file reads )

NON-BLOCKING CODE - does not block execution  
(example - read file asynchronously  it means the the program doing things without blocking time  and not wait for use cases)
